# Testdocument

The program has been tested using JUnit tests and manual testing.

### Test classes

Current test classes:

[AStarTest](https://github.com/synesteesia/pathAlgorithms/blob/master/pathAlgorithms/src/test/java/AStarTest.java), [DijkstraTest](https://github.com/synesteesia/pathAlgorithms/blob/master/pathAlgorithms/src/test/java/DijkstraTest.java) and [ParserTest](https://github.com/synesteesia/pathAlgorithms/blob/master/pathAlgorithms/src/test/java/ParserTest.java).


### Test coverage

Current test coverage is 84%, this includes some redundant code tho.

### Algorithm comparing via tests

JUnit testing is still needed for comparison. AStar algorithm has some cases where the path found isn't optimal, this should be noted in tests as well.
Currently algorithm comparing is done manually and will include more comparison ie. with algorithm speed. At the moment the program only prints shortest paths from start coordintates to goal given by each alorithm. Instructions for manual testing can be found in the instructions document.
