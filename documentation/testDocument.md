# Testdocument

The program has been tested using JUnit tests and manual testing.

### Test classes

Current test classes:

[AStarTest](https://github.com/synesteesia/pathAlgorithms/blob/master/pathAlgorithms/src/test/java/AStarTest.java), [DijkstraTest](https://github.com/synesteesia/pathAlgorithms/blob/master/pathAlgorithms/src/test/java/DijkstraTest.java) and [ParserTest](https://github.com/synesteesia/pathAlgorithms/blob/master/pathAlgorithms/src/test/java/ParserTest.java).


### Test coverage

Current test coverage is 65%, this includes some redundant code and will be brought up soon.

### Algorithm comparing via tests

Currently algorithm comparing is done manually and will include more comparison ie. with algorithm speed. JUnit testing is still needed for comparison. AStar algorithm has some cases where the path found isn't optimal, this should be noted in tests as well.
