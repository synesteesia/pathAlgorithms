[Hour reporting](https://github.com/synesteesia/pathAlgorithms/blob/master/documentation/weeklyReports/Hour_reporting.md)

## What has happened during week 1

* Coming up with a topic
* Project creation
* Project definition documentation
* Research


## Problems

Sadly I missed the first lecture, 
wich added some confusion with tring to come up with a good project topic.

## Next week

Lots of research into pathfinding algorithms, 
designing the project structure, 
start coding using ready data structures that will be replaced later.
I need to revisit some testing practices as well.
